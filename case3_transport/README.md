#Case3: Transport problem of a single tracer
This test-case implements and solves a simple transport problem of a single tracer.

The numerical scheme adopted is the finite volume method with an Upwind scheme approximation for the advection term.

In the data.pot file it is possible to choose between the esplicit or implicit upwind scheme.
